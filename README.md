### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Spring 2023

+ Project Title: The Evolution of Ideas within Philosophical Schools
+ This project is conducted by Srushti Sanghavi

+ Project summary: This project uses the 'History of Philosophy' dataset from Kaggle to analyze philosophy texts of various authors. The focal point of this project is to analyze the evolution of schools within the branch of philosophy. There are several schools, each with their own objectives and ideas, and I am analyzing whether these schools have evolved over time. Mainly I am comparing the texts of each school during various periods and analyzing if the texts resonate with the original objective of the school when it was formed.
